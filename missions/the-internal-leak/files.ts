INCIDENT TIMELINE RECONSTRUCTION
==================================================

July 1, 2025:
22:30 - First suspicious VPN connection from IP 185.220.101.45 (TOR exit node)
22:35 - Unauthorized access attempt to Sentinel-X file repository
22:47 - Failed login attempt with admin credentials (3 attempts)
23:15 - Successful login using aaron.cole@nexus-corp.com credentials

July 2, 2025:
03:35 - Physical badge access: Aaron Cole (NC-2847)
03:42 - Network login from internal workstation WS-457
03:45 - Large file access: /classified/sentinel-x/* (2.3GB transferred)
03:52 - External USB device detected and mounted
04:00 - Encrypted communication sent to IP 45.32.167.89 (CyberShield subsidiary)
04:15 - Financial transaction logged: $75,000 incoming wire
04:25 - System logs show evidence deletion attempts

==================================================
ATTACK VECTOR ANALYSIS
==================================================

1. SOCIAL ENGINEERING: Target exploited financial pressure
2. INSIDER THREAT: Employee with legitimate system access
3. BYPASS TECHNIQUES: --skip-audit flag used to avoid detection
4. DATA EXFILTRATION: USB and network transfer methods combined
5. PAYMENT MECHANISM: Offshore accounts and cryptocurrency mixing

==================================================
EVIDENCE CORRELATION
==================================================

- Badge access logs match network activity timeline
- Financial transactions coincide with data theft
- Encrypted communications indicate pre-planned operation
- Source code suggests knowledge of internal bypass methods

**CRITICAL FINDING:**
This was not a random attack. Evidence points to long-term planning
and coordination with external threat actors.

**IMMEDIATE RECOMMENDATIONS:**
1. Revoke all access for suspect employee
2. Implement emergency security protocols  
3. Contact federal cybercrime division
4. Begin damage assessment for Sentinel-X project
